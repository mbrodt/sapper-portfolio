I wrote a post on Twitter and LinkedIn recently, asking about everyone's biggest struggle when learning to code.

The absolute most common answer: What projects to build when practicing or trying to land a coding job.

It's a great question. On one hand you want to make something cool and unique - but on the other, you might not be comfortable enough with your skills to do that yet.

So, here's my take. Start by building some of the popular classics:

1. Todolist application
2. Weather application
3. Simple calculator UI
4. Movie browser with watchlist

These are solid starting points that will teach you a lot of fundamental coding concepts. They're also rather easy to find tutorials for, which is great in the beginning.

When you work on these projects, try to add your own personal twist. Play around with the design, add a few extra features etc. That'll help make the project stand out (at least a bit) from a generic solution.

However, as you get more comfortable with coding, the fastest way to improve is to build something that's relevant to **you personally.**

Think of an app that you would actually like to use yourself. Examples:

- If you're into fitness, create a simple fitness tracker app
- If you invest in crypto, create a crypto tracking website
- If you like cooking, build a recipe storage app

It doesn't matter that these already exist - your version of them doesn't exist. And since you're building it for yourself, you can make it exactly how you want it.

As a bonus, the intrinsic motivation of building something you actually want to use is amazing for productivity.

If you still can't think of anything to build that you would actually use, one other approach could work: simply browse through a list of projects [like this one](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) or [this one here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) and pick the one you think sounds most interesting. That should help you get started.

Remember: At the end of the day, what you build isn't the most important.

As long as you keep building **something** and improve your skills that way.
