It's very common to think that you **have to** be good at math to be a good programmer. This is a question I've seen a lot, and I've even asked it myself.

Before I began learning to code, I was always afraid of programming because I assumed it required heavy math knowledge. Even though I liked math, and was decent at it in school, I couldn't imagine working with complicated mathematics every day for a job - and that's what I thought programming was!

But then I realized something: Coding/programming is an incredibly broad field. There's many paths to choose, from front-end development, to machine learning, to native app development. From embedded systems, to game programming to backend API development.

I also realized that very few of those fields require extensive math knowledge, while others require basically none at all.

I've worked as a front-end developer for years, and I can count on one hand the times I've needed any remotely complicated math - and even then, it's been just a Google search away. I get away fine just knowing basic math operations.

Now that's not true for every coding area, so keep that in mind. If you're interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence or 3D programming (like games), math will be an invaluable asset and you'll have a tough time if you don't enjoy it.

What's most important though, is that you're able to **think logically and break problems down.** At the end of the day, all programming is problem solving: using code to get from Point A to Point B. So if you're able to work systematically and pragmatically, you'll do just fine in most programming fields.
