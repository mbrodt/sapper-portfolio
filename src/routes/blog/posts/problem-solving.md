When we work as developers, our job is actually not to write code. That might sound counterintuitive, but hear me out:

**Our job is to solve problems. For businesses, users and clients.**

Now don't get me wrong - programming is a great tool to solve problems. It's flexible, inherently scalable, and incredibly powerful. But being a good programmer is not (and should not) be the be-all end-all goal for us. At the end of the day, we need to be good at problem solving. We then need to channel our problem solving skills to make money for our company/clients, and help our users with whatever they're trying to do.

Problem solving can come in many forms, though. Some are low-level, concrete coding problems, while others are larger, architectural type problems. Whatever it is, practicing your problem solving abilities will prove immensely useful for your entire career. I recently published a Twitter thread with my favourite approach to improve your problem solving, and I think it's a great read to improve this key skill. So check it out if you want to level up as a developer and further your career:
